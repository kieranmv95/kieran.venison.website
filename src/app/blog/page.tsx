Unpopular opinion, but sometimes, a more extended interview process is beneficial. In development, I often hear people complain about having more than two interviews before receiving an offer, while simultaneously seeking a substantial salary!

If the company is rigorously vetting you, assessing your communication across various business facets, and engaging in paired programming exercises, it indicates a genuine effort to find a good fit for the team.

I don't believe you can achieve that level of understanding in just a couple of interviews.

From my perspective, if everyone else on your team has undergone a similar process, starting means you join a group of individuals who have demonstrated they belong precisely where they are in the business and should be a solid cultural fit.

3-4 hour hackathon to build a game, built in an alpha engine that one of the devs made!

Very fun challenge and amazed that all the teams managed to develop functional mini-games in that tiny window.

Happy new year to all my connections ðŸŽ‰ Wishing everyone a great 2024!

New Year Update:

I have been quiet about it but I start my new role with Little Journey on the 4th of January, Really excited about this as it aligns with a lot of my beliefs both personally and professionally!

Updated my [personal website](https://www.kieranvenison.co.uk/) to make use NextJS 13 features and adopted tailwind to trim down all the boilerplate and custom helper classes I had.

Wrote a small [article on dev.to](https://dev.to/kieranmv95/tailwind-my-altered-opinion-1of3) about tailwind and I also cross posted this to my updated website, so please check it out

Ever since switching to apple silicon, it means the laptop doesn't get hot enough to comfortably place it on my legs when wearing shorts. I used to run a build or run jest and my laptop was warm enough to be comfortable. no more.
  
Nice problem to have :D
